          <h3 class="post-title">Styling Time III</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Today I add line-height to the paragraph elements and changed the font. So I'm currently doing a challenge on the app. I'm supposed to make the background color of every other post a light gray color. I've found the code for that but it won't work for some reason. So after a very long and difficult time I just gave up. I continued onto the solutions. I was supposed to change the "container" class to "post-container." I was adding the pseudo class just to the "post" class. I'm not exactly sure why it had to be the container but i think I sort of understand.</p>
            <p>So I'm going to publish my website now. I've created an account on Github and I'm going to create something called repository and I have no idea what that is.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I've accomplished quite a bit today as well. I've styled the footer and starting on the content. I'm trying to figure out how to make the before and after pictures look presentable within the posts. I've figured out how to resize them but I don't have them aligned how I would like. I would also like to make it to where they appear full size when you hover over them but I'm not yet at the point of fully understanding the hover aspect. I'm not even sure exactly what to call it. I think it's a pseudo-class but I can't recall. After checking my notes I can confirm that it is indeed a pseudo-class. I need to quit doubting myself. But anyway, back to work.</p>

            <p>So I finished going back over the CSS lessons. Now we're going to follow the project lesson and style my website so it looks decent and not like this anymore. I'll leave a before and after picture under this post. I've created a new file called "styles.css" in which I choose how I want this website to look. There are many changes such as the text color, I made the header look like an actual section and added color to the background of that as well as the text. Before: <img class="resize" src="Screenshot (1).png"> <img class="resize" src="Screenshot (2).png"> After: <img class="resize" src="Screenshot (4).png"> <img class="resize" src="Screenshot (5).png"> </p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Introducing Mimo And Plans For My Website</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>So I'm learning to code again off of this app called <a href="https://getmimo.com/">Mimo</a>. Right now I'm doing a challenge where I'm supposed to add a post from another person but that just sounds stupid to me. Instead I'm writing this post. I've also decided that I'm going to make a post about all the updates I do to the website everyday. So that I may actually track the progress of this website. So, today I added the about me page as well as the contact link. I think I'm done with the basics of the website. I'm going to review to CSS course because we're going to style my website into a presentable and publishable website next.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">How I Discovered I Wanted To Be A Web Developer</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p><strong>I</strong> had always <em>loved</em> the way code looked and worked. I was fascinated by the way typing out a few words could create a website on the internet. I took it upon myself to try and learn how to code by myself.</p>
            <p><strong>W</strong>hile it worked, I knew I needed a bit more. I needed to know how this code was working and how it came to be. I needed to know about computers so I could understand how these words were turned into a fully functional website for the world to use. Senior year I took a computer science class in hopes that I would learn how to code. We used sites such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://codehs.com/">CodeHS</a>.</p>

          <p>Hi there! I'm an aspiring web developer. I've attempted making websites before and I have failed to keep up with them. I'm more dedicated to this now, I will create my website and I'll keep up with blog posts. This is for more me to see my progress and not really intended others. And if you have stumbled upon my website then welcome but I don't assume you got here on your own. I must have shown this website to you so I hope you like it.</p>
